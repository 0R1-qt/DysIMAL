Dyscalculia Immediate Mode of Assessment in Learning System

Developmental Dyscalculia (D.D.) is a general term for severe difficulties in mathematics. It includes all types of mathematical difficulties varying from the ineptitude in understanding the synchronicity and the meaning of numbers to the incapacity to apply mathematics principles to solve problems.

In order to help medical professionals to determine children with developmental dyscalculia, the researchers came up with a study focusing on assessing children via a sequence of diagnostic tests from Woodcock-Johnson IV regarding difficulties in mathematics suitable for children ages 9-12.

A quantitative approach, such as the ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation), was used to develop the system. The said system is designed as an electronic tablet device using a touch monitor and a microcontroller, with an installed software application used to conduct the sequence of digital and automated tests the respondents should take. The test results collected from the system are stored in a database and used by medical professionals to determine and monitor children diagnosed with the said disorder. The system was tested in Barangay Mintal, Tugbok, Davao City.
